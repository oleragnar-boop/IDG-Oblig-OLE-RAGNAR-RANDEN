        24.Create a step by step tutorial on how to create a cronjob that prints “Task scheduled at”+ DATE. Cronjob is
        scheduled every 30 minutes on today’s date(only today).
    </h3>
    <p>Cronjob tutorial.</p>
    <p>Steps:</p>
    <p>1. Access the root user by typing in "sudo -s" and entering the password to the user.</p>
    <p>2. Create a cronjob by typing "crontab -e" and select your editor if prompted to. The nano editor is recommended.
    </p>
    <p>3. To get a cronjob that prints "Task scheduled at DATE" every 30 minutes on today's date (only today) you would
        have to:</p>
    <p>- Make a file for the script to output. For example "touch obligtutorial.txt" will create a txt file named
        obligtutorial.</p>
    <p>- Set the scheduele of execution to todays date, and every 30 minutes. in this case it would be 30 * 19 11 4.
        since the date of writing this tutorial is thursday the 19th of november.</p>
    <p>- Find the path to the file you created earlier. In this case the "obligtutorial.txt" file is in a directory
        called "obligweb". The path looks like this "/home/olerr/obligweb/obligtutorial.txt"</p>
    <p>- To make the cronjob output something at all, "echo" will be used. "echo "Task scheduled at $(date)" is the
        syntax for this particular cronjob.</p>
    <p>- Now combine the three parts.</p>
    <p>- The whole script for this cronjob is: "30 * 19 11 4 echo "Task scheduled at $(date)" >>
        /home/olerr/obligweb/obligtutorial.txt"</p>
    <p>4. After making (and saving) the cronjob, you will have to start it.</p>
    <p>- First check the status of the cronjob by typing "service cron status" a message will say wether the cron
        service is running or not.</p>
    <p>- If it's not running, type "service cron start". Now the cronjob should be running. You can check this with the
        "service cron status" command, it should now say "cron is running".</p>
    <p>5. After the 30 minute mark of an hour you can check the output file you made earlier. If done correctly it will
        now have text that looks somewhat like this "Task scheduled at Thu Nov 19 23:30:01 CET 2020".</p>
    <p>6. Congratulations! You have now made a cronjob! Well done!</p>

        25.Create a script that takes an input (letter or number) that will display the answer of a question. The script
        should when started list a menu for the user with the different questions that can be chosen and which
        corresponding letter the user will have to give as input to display the answer of the desired question. One of
        the possible inputs the user should be able to make is "q" for quitting the script. The menu should also have a
        defaultcase where all the items is displayed again,or no changes is made if the user gives an invalid input.
